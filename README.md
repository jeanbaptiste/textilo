# 10 steps to assemble a textilo soft electronic board

* 1. Locate ( https://github.com/jeanbaptiste/textilo/blob/master/README.md ) , Read in your language & Understand this tutorial :)
* 2. Order the components 
	* 5x5 cm Flectron conductive textile http://www.lessemf.com/1212.pdf (specs Width: 1080 mm (42.5 inch)- Thickness: 0.08mm (3 mil)- Weight: 80 g/mÂ² (about 35% Copper)- Surface Resistivity: 0.05 Ohm/sq. )
	* 5 x 5 Neoprene textile 
	* 5 cm fusible glue paper
	* Mild Adhesive
	* 10 uF *polarized* capacitor
	* 100 uF *polarized* capacitor
	* 100 Ohms resistance 
	* NE555 timer IC in DIP (dual inline package)
* 3. Cut a 5 cm neoprene disc
* 4. With a small soldering iron, stick the fusible on the flectron
* 5. Cut the Fusible + Flectron compound with the Plotter according this schematics (DXF, other formats..)
* 6. Remove unwanted parts of the circuit and apply Mild adhesive
* 7. Place the circuit on the neoprene, remove mild adhesive and iron it
* 8. Solder the components
* 9. Test by placing a 3v to 15v battery on the PLUS & round pad underneath it, a resistive sensor on the two upper pads (INPUT) and an actuator (8 ohm speaker for instance) on the two lower pads (OUTPUT).
