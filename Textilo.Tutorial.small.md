# STEPS TO ASSEMBLE A TEXTILO with small electronic components:

* 1. Locate, Read in your language & Understand this tutorial :)
* 2. Order the components (4x4 cm Flectron conductive textile, 4 x 4 Neoprene textile, 4 cm Fusible Glue paper, Mild Adhesive, 10 uF *polarized* ceramic 1206 SMD capacitor,  (T491 Kemet),  100 uF *polarized* ceramic 1206 SMD capacitor (T491 Kemet), 100 Ohms resistance 1206 SMD, NE555 SOIC illustrator)
* 3. Cut a 4 cm neoprene disc
* 4. With a small soldering iron, stick the fusible on the flectron
* 5. Cut the Fusible + Flectron compound with the Plotter according this schematics (DXF, other formats..)
* 6. Remove unwanted parts of the circuit and apply Mild adhesive
* 7. Place the circuit on the neoprene, remove mild adhesive and iron it
* 8. solder the components
